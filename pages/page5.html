			<div class="text zoomable" style="margin-bottom: 55px">
				<p>Leicester City is reportedly asking for a fee of £60m for the winger plus add-ons.</p>
				<p>Guardiola is turning to Mahrez after Sanchez joined United.</p>
				<p>The manager also intends on acquiring a defensive midfielder.</p>

			<h2 class="informer-title title-secondary">Di Maria in talks with Napoli</h2>
			<div class="text zoomable">
				<p>The 30-year-old Argentina international's is due to expire next summer, meaning he would be available for an affordable price.</p>
				<p>Di Maria can play a number of attacking roles, but primarily on the right flank, which would make him a replacement for Jose Callejon who has been linked to a move to Milan.</p>
				<p>Carlo Ancelotti is due to take over imminently and it would be a reunion with Di Maria, as they worked together at Real Madrid from 2013 to 2015.</p>

			<h2 class="informer-title title-secondary">Pep Guardiola considers making move for Matthijs de Ligt</h2>
			<div class="text zoomable" style="margin-top: 30px">
				<p>The Ajax defender could replace an aging Vincent Kompany at Manchester City.</p>
				<p>De Ligt fits the profile of a young, technically astute defender who could slot into City’s playing style.</p>
				<p>The 18-year-old defender has made 34 appearances in all competitions this season, and could provide consistency unlike Kompany, who is an ongoing injury concern to Guardiola.  The captain is also entering the final year of his contract and, while he may be considered for an extension, there are no guarantees.</p>
