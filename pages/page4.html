    <p>Iniesta joined the Barcelona youth academy when he was 12; he found his way to the first team six years later and since then became a vital player on the Catalan team, putting his name as one of the greatest in the history of the club.</p>
    <p>The midfielder was on the starting line-up in Barcelona’s last league game of the season, and he entered the pitch wearing Barca’s arm band for the last time in his career. </p>
    <p>The Spaniard was highly received by the fans, who chanted his name with every touch. He enjoyed his last minutes on the same pitch where he experienced being a footballer for the first time.</p>

    <p>Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde substituted Coutinho for Lionel Messi, who had the chance to play the last 15 minutes alongside Iniesta. </p>
    <p>Messi and Iniesta shared Barca’s dressing room ever since they were youngsters dreaming of being world-class players. </p>
    <p>The minute everyone was afraid of came eight minutes before the final whistle when Don Andres was substituted. Andres gave the captain armband to his friend, Lionel Messi. </p>
    <p>Iniesta received applauds from the fans, his teammates, Sociedad players and every football fan around the world. </p>
    <p>Iniesta left Barcelona after achieving the domestic double in his last season with the club, and he also scored in the Cup final.</p>
    <p>He received the league title after the game and celebrated with his teammates, who wore jerseys with his name on the back. </p>
    <p>Iniesta has left a legacy at Camp Nou and earned a special place in football fans’ hearts forever. </p>
