				<p>Manchester City want Mikel Arteta to take over from Pep Guardiola and are ready to hand the Spaniard a new contract, according to reports.</p>
				<p>The former Arsenal captain did have his heart set on becoming Arsene Wenger’s successor and was gutted to learn the Gunners had decided to appoint Unai Emery.</p>
				<p>Arteta’s lack of experience in a managerial role seems to have been the deciding factor in Arsenal’s final decision.</p>
				<p>Arsenal have opted for experience in Unai Emery who has previously been in charge at Paris Saint-Germain, Sevilla, Spartak Moscow and Valencia.</p>
