				<label>"I anticipate a difficult weekend. We may not have the pace of the others..." - Lewis Hamilton on Mercedes' Monaco chances</label>
			</div>

				<p>Lewis Hamilton reckons the advantage could swing Red Bull's way in Monaco, referencing the team's supreme pace in Barcelona's slow-speed final sector, which is often a barometer for Monte Carlo form.</p>
				<p>Mercedes struggled to assert their authority in the opening three races before somehwat fortuitously taking victory in Azerbaijan. But in Spain, they appeared to be back to their dominant best. Hamilton feels the team still have plenty of work to do, but they are making progress, which bodes well for the coming races.</p>
